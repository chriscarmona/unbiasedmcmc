# The files of the debiasedmcmc/inst/reproduce*
# contain the scripts to reproduce the figures, model by model.
#

# Each folder has a "run.all.R" script that can be run to execute each script in the correct order
# and to produce tables/figures.

# The files finishing in .plots.R create the plots and tables.

# The Ising model and variable selection examples contain further execution on how
# to execute batch scripts in parallel, on a cluster or via GNU parallel.

# Note that there might be hardcoded paths to be modified before executing the scripts.
