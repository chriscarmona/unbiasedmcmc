TODO:
- make a meeting time function that could handle MH, Gibbs and HMC
At the moment it's done with different functions in every script!
- remove all the commented lines, and remove unnecessary packages



These scripts produce the results of Section 4,
on the scaling of the proposed couplings with respect to the dimension.

The target is multivariate Normal
with mean 0 and variance defined as the inverse of a Wishart(d, I_d) distribution,
where d is the dimension, and I_d is the identity matrix of dimension d.
For the Gibbs sampler, another target with weak correlations is also considered.

Each script corresponds to a different algorithm, and runs the simulation
with chains started either at stationarity, or from a Normal(1_d, I_d), where 1_d is a vector of ones.



Scripts:

-  scaling.rwmh.maximalcoupling.R: random walk Metropolis Hastings,
with maximal coupling of the Gaussian proposals (that is the coupling referred to as gamma-coupling, with independent residuals).

-  scaling.rwmh.reflectionmaxcouping.R: random walk Metropolis Hastings,
with reflection-maximal coupling of the Gaussian proposals (that is the coupling described in Bou-Rabee, Eberle & Zimmer 2018, with mirrored residuals)

-  scaling.gibbs.R: MH within Gibbs,
  with max coupling of each proposal,
  both on the target described above and on a target with weak correlations.

-  scaling.hmc.R: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
  with preconditioned mass matrix, synchronous coupling of momenta in HMC steps, combined with MH moves, as described in Heng & Jacob 2018.

- scaling.plots.R creates the plots, with the files created by the above scripts.
